            <h2>Review changes to students
                <span>This page allows you to see the impact on students based on the moderated standards you set on the previous screen.</span>

            <p>
                The table is sortable by any of the columns. All students who answered the same items correctly, not the same number of items, will get the same score. Only students who answered harder questions will get higher scores.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you believe the grade values or percentage scores do not properly reflect the quality of student performance, click BACK and move the grade boundary markers.
