                SmartStandardSet analyses multiple-choice question test results using an item response theory (IRT) algorithm that gives higher marks to students who answer harder questions correctly. The algorithm identifies the quality of each item and estimates student ability based on performance. The system allows academic staff to remove items with poor item characteristics and then set grade standards based on the difficulty of items and appropriate standards.

				The work was funded by the University of Auckland Learning Enhancement Grants awarded in 2018 to <em>Prof. Gavin Brown</em> (Education &amp; Social Work) and <em>Dr. Paul Denny</em> (Computer Science). The software was developed by <em>Ellen Li</em>, an undergraduate software engineering student at The University of Auckland. <em>Dr. David San Jose</em>, a post-doctoral research assistant, has conducted interviews and focus groups with students and academic staff that generated insights from intended users about the utility, accuracy, and feasibility of the system.
